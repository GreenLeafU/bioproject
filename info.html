  <p>⚠️Many bugs and undeveloped features are still present, including:</p>
  <p>-Answer location and hitboxes not fully optimized</p>
  <p>-Lack of quality in giving question and answers</p>
  <p>-Lack of content and connectivity</p>
  <p>We hope you can enjoy our educational game and forgive us for any mistakes</p>
